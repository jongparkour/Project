# 🌞 Solar-Powered Solutions for Efficient Water Distribution

## 📘 Introduction

**Solar-Powered Solutions for Efficient Water Distribution** is a solar-powered, Arduino-based water management system designed to provide an efficient and sustainable solution for communities in remote, mountainous areas where water access is limited. The system automates water pumping, monitors water levels to prevent overflow, and continuously tracks water quality using a turbidity sensor. Data is displayed in real-time on an OLED screen, and the system is housed in a compact casing for field readiness. The project demonstrates the system's ability to lift water to a height of one meter using renewable solar energy. Future upgrades include integrating a pH sensor and a GSM module for wireless monitoring and SMS notifications.
