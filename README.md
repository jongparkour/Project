# Project Title 
# Solar-Powered Solutions for Efficient Water Distribution

Objective: The primary objectives of this initiative are to design a resilient, solar-powered water pumping system, 
and to develop a reservoir system that features water level detection. 
In addition, the project aims to integrate water quality sensors for continuous monitoring. 
This strategic focus ensures a cost-effective and sustainable solution that significantly improves water accessibility in hard-to-reach regions.
