PIN Connections

Arduino UNO:

	RELAY_PIN: Connect to pin D2 on the Arduino. This pin controls the relay that turns the water pump on and off.
	WATER_LEVEL_PIN: Connect to pin A0 on the Arduino. This pin reads the output from the water level sensor.
	TURBIDITY_PIN: Connect to pin A1 on the Arduino. This pin reads the output from the turbidity sensor.

1 Channel Relay 5V:

	IN: Connect to pin D2 on the Arduino (this is the same as the RELAY_PIN).
	VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
	GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
	COM: Connect to the positive pin of the water pump.
	NO: Connect to the negative pin of the water pump.

Water Level Sensor:

	SIG: Connect to pin A0 on the Arduino (this is the same as the WATER_LEVEL_PIN).
	VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
	GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.

Turbidity Sensor:

	OUT: Connect to pin A1 on the Arduino (this is the same as the TURBIDITY_PIN).
	VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
	GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.

5V Mini Water Pump:

	Positive Pin: Connect to the COM pin of the relay.
	Negative Pin: Connect to the NO pin of the relay.

OLED Display (0.96" OLED):

	SDA: Connect to the SDA pin on the Arduino (typically A4 on the UNO).
	SCK: Connect to the SCL pin on the Arduino (typically A5 on the UNO).
	VDD: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
	GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.

XL4015 5A DC Buck Step-down:

	Input +: Connect to the output of the solar panel (VCC).
	Input -: Connect to the ground of the solar panel (GND).
	Output +: Connect to the Vin pin of the Arduino.
	Output -: Connect to the GND pin of the Arduino.
